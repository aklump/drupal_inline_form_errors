* Forked at 38b891d because the module did not seem to work.  I refactored how the `ife_element_errors_set()` works in relationship to the `#parents` check.  This appears to make it work correctly now with children of a form, when the form itself is sent.
* I didn't bother with drupal.org on this.  This module doesn't appear to be well supported anymore, so making it work for our use case only.

* I added the ability to translate the form errors using t()  You can do something like this in settings.php

        $conf['locale_custom_strings_en']['form_user_login'] = [
            'Username or email field is required.' => 'Please enter your username or email address.',
        ];
